# Unfollow
Chrome extension that automatically unfollows everyone on Facebook without unfriending them.

## Why?
Because your Facebook feed is full of junk, posted by people you are likely don’t care about. You’re spending hours because you’re afraid to miss really important update (or you just procrastinate). You’d like not to see updates of all these people but keep them in friends though. 

But Facebook doesn’t allow easy unsubscribe/unfollow mechanism: currently you need to remove each person by hand. It’s tedious and time-consuming. That’s probably because Facebook doesn’t want you to unfollow people: more posts you see -> more data & ads -> more money. 

Unfollow will automatically unfollow everyone. Then you can manually follow back people or pages you care about. 

## How does it work? 
Unfollow will unsubscribe from people just like you. It will go to unfollow page of your profile and click on every person and page to unfollow them (with the help of browser events)

*Important! Currently it’s all-or-nothing approach: it can only unfollow everyone or no one.*
Better ways are most likely exist, e.g. for selective mass unfollowing but you would need to use Facebook API which I don’t have possibility time to explore right now. 

*Important! It may be hard to follow people back.*
If you think you will need to follow many people back after unfollowing, you may not want to use this extension. 

## How to use? 
 1. Install Chrome extension.
 2. Log in into your Facebook account. 
 3. Click Unfollow.
 4. (optionally) Remove the extension. 
 
## Will people who I am unfollowing see that I have unsubscribed? 
No. Or at least most likely no. 

## Will you (developer) see people I am unfollowing? 
No. We do not collect any data and the code is open-sourced so you can be sure we know nothing about usage.
